## 🏺 Overview

This mod menu is a **real-time customization panel** for survival, combat flow, traversal clarity, and world awareness.
It does not break the integrity of Conan Exiles—
it refines it, tames rough edges, and gives you better insight into danger, opportunity, and momentum.

With it, you can adjust:

* movement and camera handling
* resource visibility and node tracking
* thrall identification logic
* hazard & boss AoE cues
* stamina and encumbrance comfort
* night vision, cave clarity
* HUD readability for long sessions

It’s about **survival comfort**, not shortcuts.
